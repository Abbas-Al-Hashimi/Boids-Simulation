# Boids Simulation (Python)

A simple implementation of Craig Reynolds' *Boids* model to simulate flocking behavior.

## Features
- Separation, alignment, and cohesion rules
- Adjustable parameters for speed, vision radius, and repulsion
- Simple 2D visualization
- Demonstrates basic simulation loops and vector operations in Python

## Run
```bash
python boids.pyThe code requires pygame and python3
